# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) programming challenges. Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve a series of coding puzzles, one for each day leading up to Christmas. It's a great opportunity to sharpen your programming skills and have some festive fun!

In 2023, I am using Advent of Code as a means to learn new programming languages, and remember some forgotten ones!

## Structure

The repository is organized by years, with each year containing folders for each day of the Advent of Code. Inside each day's folder, you'll find the problem, input, and any additional resources or notes related to the problem.
